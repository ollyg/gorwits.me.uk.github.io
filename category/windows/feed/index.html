				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently at work I migrated from a Linux desktop to a Windows 7 desktop. This is an account of how I then configured the Win7 system.</p>
<p>First I should mention that working somewhere where they actually have an official, managed Linux desktop is awesome. However for the way I do things, it&#8217;s just not too pleasant an experience. On Linux I got tired of never being able to print something in the appropriate orientation. I also used to spend at least 50% of my time in the Windows VM anyway, working in MS Word/Excel/Visio.</p>
<p>The rest of my time is spent in Chrome and SSH in a terminal. So the first things to install on Win7 are Chrome and <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html" target="_blank">PuTTY</a>. I created a directory called Applications in my home folder and saved apps such as PuTTY, which do not come with automated installers, there.</p>
<p>I pinned a shortcut to my home folder to the taskbar. This is trickier than it sounds, as you have to do a two-level right click to get to the pinned folder <em>properties</em> window, then edit the <em>Target:</em> field (and possibly the icon if desired). I still don&#8217;t fully understand the Win7 &#8220;Library&#8221; system.</p>
<p>To make PuTTY sessions more manageable, I installed <del>two</del>Â three additional apps. First is <a href="http://www.raisin.de/putty-tabs/putty-tabs.html" target="_blank">PuttyTabs</a>, which despite its age works just fine, and allows easy firing-up of a shell to one of our servers, and management of the windows once open. Rarely I might also use <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/macdsite/utilidades/puttytabmanager/" target="_blank">PuTTYTabManager</a> for staged system maintenance when I need to work on several similar systems at once (KDE&#8217;s terminal app is a superb tabbed experience which I do miss).</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> <em>The <a href="http://puttysm.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">PuTTY Session Manager</a> is another useful app to manage the session list; it can copy attributes/settings between session configs, and backup/restore session configs in bulk.</em></p>
<p>Once a few windows are up and running I long for focus-follows-mouse. It&#8217;s not available on my iMac at home, but Win7 does have a registry key one can poke. Well done MS! Good luck with <a href="http://sinewalker.wordpress.com/2010/03/10/ms-windows-focus-follows-mouse-registry-hacks/" target="_blank">the process</a>, which I think could benefit from improvedÂ <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc957204.aspx" target="_blank">official documentation</a> (pay attention to the comments on that page, as well).</p>
<p>The next little gem to install is <a href="http://www.autohotkey.com/" target="_blank">AutoHotKey</a>, as I have an Apple keyboard and like to remap some keys (for example the # sign which I use a lot). Here&#8217;s my current config:</p>
<pre class="brush: plain; title: ; notranslate">
#singleinstance force
Â§::Send {RAlt Down}3{RAlt Up}
LWin::LCtrl
::Remy::RÃ©my
</pre>
<p>This maps #-sign onto the unused section-sign (Â§) key. It also remaps the left Windows key, which on the Apple UK keyboard is of course the Command key, to be a left Control key. This means at home and at work my left thumb can take care of cut/copy/paste. Finally the last line means I always use the correct spelling for my manager&#8217;s name <img src='http://blog.gorwits.me.uk/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>By the way, I did also install the Apple software drivers for Win7 from their Boot Camp installer on the OS X install disk. This sets the correct keymap for my Apple UK keyboard, as well as enabling the special function keys such as volume control.</p>
<p>The next app, in no way less awesome, is <a href="http://dexpot.de/" target="_blank">Dexpot</a>, which provides true, full-featured virtual desktop support for Windows. I have four desktops, and use the application pinning feature so that everything in my <em>startup</em> folder is put in the right place when I boot (which isn&#8217;t that often, to be honest). Plugins enabled include Dexcube (3D switching effects), MouseEvents (hot corners), and SevenDex (shortcut buttons in taskbar).</p>
<p>In case you&#8217;re not familiar with Dexpot, there are loads of features included (for instance context menu items on window taskbars, to allow moving them between desktops or show-on-all). One thing I&#8217;d like built-in is using the scroll-wheel on the desktop background to change virtual desktop; apparently it&#8217;s possible with an AutoHotKey script.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s it for the main tweaks. Here&#8217;s a list of some of the other applications I&#8217;ve installed:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.last.fm/download" target="_blank">last.fm standalone player</a></li>
<li><a href="http://winscp.net/eng/index.php" target="_blank">WinSCP</a></li>
<li><a href="http://gajim.org/" target="_blank">Gajim</a> (instant messaging)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.wireshark.org/" target="_blank">Wireshark</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.linuxliveusb.com/" target="_blank">LinuxLive USB Creator</a> (make bootable usb stick from ISO image)</li>
<li><a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/" target="_blank">notepad++</a></li>
<li><a href="http://tortoisesvn.net/" target="_blank">TortoiseSVN</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, after a couple of months now with the Win7 desktop, it&#8217;s a vast improvement on Linux. I know some of you may argue all of the above is possible with Linux. I don&#8217;t disagree, except to add that it isn&#8217;t <em>easy</em>. A well-configured desktop is a means to an end, not an end in itself. The Win7 experience is beautiful and slick, and makes me happier in my work &#8211; what more can I say?</p>
<p>(I&#8217;ll tell you what else I can say&#8230;. I&#8217;d still prefer an iMac!)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPNEGO" target="_blank">SPNEGO</a> is a negotiated authentication mechanism for HTTP which can be used to take advantage of Kerberos credentials for web site login (an alternative to simple username/password, or client digital certificates).</p>
<p>The reference implementation for Apache, <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/modgssapache/" target="_blank">mod_spnego</a>, can be downloaded from SourceForge and contains straightforward build instructions. It&#8217;s also possible to use <a href="http://webauth.stanford.edu/install-spnego.html" target="_blank">Stanford WebAuth in SPNEGO mode</a>.</p>
<p>To build the module you need development libraries for the following (I&#8217;ve added the SLES package names, for reference):</p>
<ul>
<li>openssl (<code>libopenssl-devel</code>)</li>
<li>krb5 (<code>krb5-devel, krb5-devel-32bit</code>)</li>
<li>apache (<code>apache2-devel</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Follow the instructions in the module source. On SLES, be sure to run the <code>apxs</code> command as root, because it goes and installs the module directly after compilation.</p>
<p>Enabling the module is again quite straightforward:</p>
<pre class="brush: plain; title: ; notranslate">
    Krb5AuthEachReq Off
    &lt;Directory &quot;/foo/bar/quux&quot;&gt;
        AllowOverride AuthConfig
        Krb5KeyTabFile /etc/apache2/HTTP.keytab
        Krb5ServiceName HTTP
        AuthType SPNEGO
        Require valid-user
    &lt;/Directory&gt;
</pre>
<p>You&#8217;ll need to install a keytab for the HTTP service principal. The method differs depending on the type of KDC you have, but for Windows AD this would be:</p>
<pre class="brush: plain; title: ; notranslate">
net ads -U 'username@realm%password' keytab add HTTP
</pre>
<p>As verification I wrote a simple Perl CGI script to echo back <code>$ENV{REMOTE_USER}</code> which emitted <code>user@REALM</code>, as expected.</p>
<p>Sadly when testing this out I found the use of SPNEGO is not enabled by default in all browsers (for example,Â <a href="http://blob.inf.ed.ac.uk/gdutton/2010/11/chrome-and-spnego/" target="_blank">Google Chrome</a>). A managed desktop seems the only way to ensure the user has both kerberos credentials and a browser started with the correct features enabled. Otherwise, it&#8217;d be just too much work?</p>
