				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So far so good for access to the new Cat Cam: from within the house we can view video from the cats&#8217; shed, yet the camera is safely on its own DMZ.</p>
<p>In this final post I&#8217;ll show how I made the camera video feed available on the Internet.</p>
<p>One thing I wanted from the outset was for Internet clients not to make direct connections to the camera itself. I was a little worried about the ability of the web server and CPU in the camera to cope with multiple clients, and also the security implications of direct access. AÂ second requirement was to have multi platform access &#8211; that is, desktop and iOS. This potentially means different streaming video formats.</p>
<p>We have one linux server in the house, which is used for many different things and runs <a href="http://blog.gorwits.me.uk/2012/01/04/virtual-machine-on-mythbuntu/" target="_blank">virtual machines</a>. My back-of-an-envelope plan looked something like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.gorwits.me.uk/2013/01/03/internet-accessible-cats-part-2/cat-internet-3/" rel="attachment wp-att-858"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-858" title="cat-internet" src="http://blog.gorwits.me.uk/wp-content/blog.gorwits.me.uk/2012/12/cat-internet2.png" alt="" width="250" height="382" /></a></p>
<p>First step was to create the VM, but remember that the camera feed is in a DMZ using a VLAN, so the VM must live there too. In KVM it&#8217;s possible either to send all traffic to a guest system and let it process the VLANs or, you can separate the tagged VLAN traffic in the host system so the guest is dumb and just sees untagged frames. Clearly the latter is preferable so that were the guest to suffer attack from the Internet, it ought not to be able to put traffic onto the house workstation network. The guest is completely within the DMZ.</p>
<p>With that done and a basic Ubuntu system installed, I started work on Apache and <a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html" target="_blank">VLC</a> (the Swiss Army Chainsaw of video processing). First up, VLC&#8230;</p>
<p>Luckily the camera&#8217;s video feed comes in MJPEG format with a discoverable URL. The idea is to take this feed, duplicate it, and transcode the respective feeds into something suitable for a desktop browser and for iOS. As a bonus, I&#8217;ll timestamp the video to make it easy to tell if the transcoder has crashed (the timestamp would be wrong). After a <em>lot</em>Â of reading online about how to configure VLC I came up with the following monstrosity:</p>
<pre class="brush: plain; title: ; notranslate">
/usr/bin/cvlc -I dummy http://guest:guest@172.16.30.10:8888/videostream.cgi?rate=0
  --sout='#duplicate{

    dst=&quot;transcode{
      width=320,heigh=240,fps=25,vcodec=h264,vb=256,acodec=none,
      venc=x264{profile=baseline,level=30,keyint=30,ref=1},
      sfilter=marq{marquee=\&quot;[%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S]\&quot;,position=8,size=18}
    }:std{access=livehttp{
        seglen=10,delsegs=true,numsegs=5,
        index=/var/www/streaming/cats.m3u8,
        index-url=/streaming/cats-########.ts},
      mux=ts{use-key-frames},
      dst=/var/www/streaming/cats-########.ts}&quot;,

    dst=&quot;transcode{
      width=640,heigh=480,fps=25,vcodec=theo,vb=512,acodec=none,
      sfilter=marq{marquee=\&quot;[%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S]\&quot;,position=8,size=18}
    }:http{mux=ogg,dst=127.0.0.1:8081/catcam.ogg}&quot;

  }'
</pre>
<p>Of the two transcodesÂ (&#8220;dst=&#8221;), the second is more straightforward. It creates an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogg" target="_blank">Ogg</a> format stream using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theora" target="_blank">Theora</a> video codec, which modern browsers should be able to cope with. This is a video stream being served from VLC&#8217;s built-in web server, so I&#8217;ll need to proxy it via Apache. The configuration also applies a filter (&#8220;sfilter=&#8221;) to add a timestamp on the video stream.</p>
<p>The first transcode uses the new <a href="https://developer.apple.com/resources/http-streaming/" target="_blank">HTTP Live Streaming</a> support in VLC. This is a rather elegant specification from Apple (which is why I selected it for the iOS clients) for simple and efficient delivery of streaming video. It creates a set of files and assumes you have a web server to serve them. The files each contain a few seconds of video, and the client retrieves them and plays one after another. The &#8220;######&#8221; templates an incrementing number within the segment filename. Again, the timestamp is added to the video stream.</p>
<p>CPU load for the above runs at about 60% (in the VM) on the dual core Athlon X2 245e processor. I wrapped the above in an <a href="http://upstart.ubuntu.com/" target="_blank">Upstart</a> init file, and just in case VLC gets its knickers in a twist, I added a cron job to periodically stop and start the service.</p>
<p>Now on to Apache. It needs to proxy the Ogg stream and serve the Live Streaming files, and prevent any other access to the web server:</p>
<pre class="brush: plain; title: ; notranslate">
# redirect any non-cat requests to the cat index.html
RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/streaming/cats.*
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/stream/catcam.ogg$
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/index.html$
RewriteRule ^(.*) http://%{HTTP_HOST}/index.html [R,L]

ProxyReceiveBufferSize 16384
ProxyRequests On
ProxyVia On
ProxyPreserveHost On

&lt;Proxy *&gt;
    Order deny,allow
    Allow from all
&lt;/Proxy&gt;

# VLC server stream
ProxyPass /stream/catcam.ogg http://localhost:8081/catcam.ogg
ProxyPassReverse /stream/catcam.ogg http://localhost:8081/catcam.ogg
</pre>
<p>Last but not least for this server, we need a web page which offers up the two video streams. This uses an HTML5 video tag:</p>
<pre class="brush: xml; title: ; notranslate">
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Cat Cam&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;content-type&quot; content=&quot;text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1&quot;&gt;
        &lt;META HTTP-EQUIV=&quot;Pragma&quot; CONTENT=&quot;no-cache&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;Cat Cam&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;video id=&quot;video&quot; autoplay=&quot;autoplay&quot;&gt;
            &lt;source src=&quot;/streaming/cats.m3u8&quot;&gt;
            &lt;source src=&quot;/stream/catcam.ogg&quot; type=&quot;video/ogg; codecs=theora&quot;&gt;
            Your browser doesn't appear to support the HTML5 &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;video&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element.
        &lt;/video&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
<p>All that remains is to enable a NAT rule and firewall pinhole on the home router for the web server (which is, of course, in the DMZ network connected directly to the router).</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s see the end result, taken on my iPhone this evening, also demonstrating the automatically activated night vision mode:</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.gorwits.me.uk/2013/01/03/internet-accessible-cats-part-2/cat-ngith/" rel="attachment wp-att-884"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-884" title="cat-ngith" src="http://blog.gorwits.me.uk/wp-content/blog.gorwits.me.uk/2012/12/cat-ngith.png" alt="" width="400" height="267" /></a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s nice to be able to check in on the wee beasties when I&#8217;m out at work. Other than a lot of reading about VLC, it wasn&#8217;t particularly difficult to do, and I think the end result is really quite good.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iâ€™m doing a series of posts here on automated transcoding of recordings in MythTV. The idea is to explain the basics, then evolve the design to end up with recordings suitable for playback on the iPad, which is a little more advanced.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>The complete series of articles is available atÂ <a href="http://blog.gorwits.me.uk/category/transcoding/" target="_self">this page</a></em></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://blog.gorwits.me.uk/2011/09/04/mythtv-transcoding-4-streaming-h-264-from-mythweb/" target="_blank">Last time</a> we went through the steps to transcode a recording into the H.264 format, required for playback on iPad (or other Apple devices &#8211; iPod, iPhone, Mac OS X, etc).</p>
<p>Today we&#8217;ll complete the series by embedding an HTML5 Video player into MythWeb which will stream these files. Of course, this means playback isn&#8217;t only possible on iPad, but also any compatible browser platform. The original plan was simply to provide a file download link in MythWeb, but my friend <a href="http://www.colinmoreyphotography.co.uk/" target="_blank">Colin</a> rightly suggested an embedded HTML5 Video player would be much more awesome.</p>
<p>Your MythWeb files are probably installed somewhere like <code>/usr/share/mythtv/mythweb</code>. Open upÂ <code>modules/tv/tmpl/default/detail.php</code> and replace the default embedded player with a new HTML5 Video tag. You should find this around line 797. Replace the two lines comprising the Direct Download hyperlink with the following:</p>
<pre class="brush: php; title: ; notranslate">
&lt;video controls preload=&quot;none&quot; width=&quot;360&quot; height=&quot;153&quot;&gt;
  &lt;source
    src=&quot;/h264xcode/&lt;?php echo $program-&gt;chanid ?&gt;_&lt;?php echo date( 'YmdHis', $program-&gt;recstartts ) ?&gt;.m4v&quot;&gt;
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
&lt;/video&gt;
</pre>
<p>The above requires that you make the H.264 files available through your MythWeb web server. In my case, I simply created a symlink from the server&#8217;sÂ <code>DocumentRoot</code> to where the H.264 files live (so, change this to reflect your own H.264 file location):</p>
<pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">
ln -s /mnt/mythtv-video/Videos/iPad /var/www/h264xcode
</pre>
<p>The result is the following, once the transcoded file appears on disk:</p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-703" href="http://blog.gorwits.me.uk/2011/11/17/mythtv-transcoding-5-html5-playback-in-mythweb/screen-shot-2011-11-17-at-21-20-16/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-703" title="embedded html5 player" src="http://blog.gorwits.me.uk/wp-content/blog.gorwits.me.uk/2011/11/Screen-shot-2011-11-17-at-21.20.16.png" alt="" width="438" height="534" /></a></p>
<p>And we&#8217;re done! Browsing to the MythWeb site on an iPad shows the embedded player which, when clicked, opens fullscreen for native playback. My deep thanks to all those working on the software used in this series of articles, and I also hope you found it a useful read.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iâ€™m doing a series of posts here on automated transcoding of recordings in MythTV. The idea is to explain the basics, then evolve the design to end up with recordings suitable for playback on the iPad, which is a little more advanced.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>The complete series of articles is available atÂ <a href="http://blog.gorwits.me.uk/category/transcoding/" target="_self">this page</a></em></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://blog.gorwits.me.uk/2011/09/04/mythtv-transcoding-3-transcoding-for-ipad-playback/" target="_blank">Last time</a> we went through the steps to transcode a recording into the H.264 format, required for playback on iPad (or other Apple devices &#8211; iPod, iPhone, Mac OS X, etc).</p>
<p>Today we&#8217;ll complete the series by integrating this with MythWeb so that a new button appears which sets off the transcode job, and then go on to make the output available for streaming over the web. Remember that there are other ways to watch recordings on the iPad, as listed in the previous article in this series.</p>
<p>First we need to let MythTV know about the new user job command (<code>/usr/local/bin/h264xcode</code>). You can do this either in the <code>mythtv-setup</code> program, or via the MythWeb interface. Personally I use the latter, as stopping the MythTV Backend and running the setup program over an SSH tunnel is fiddly, but I&#8217;ll cover both here for completeness.</p>
<p>In <code>mythtv-setup</code> you want to selectÂ <em>General</em> and then hitÂ <em>Next</em> until you reach theÂ <em>Job Queue (Job Commands)</em> page:</p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-581" href="http://blog.gorwits.me.uk/2011/09/04/mythtv-transcoding-3-transcoding-for-ipad-playback/screen-shot-2011-09-04-at-12-30-39/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-581" title="Job Queue - Job Commands" src="http://blog.gorwits.me.uk/wp-content/blog.gorwits.me.uk/2011/09/Screen-shot-2011-09-04-at-12.30.39.png" alt="" width="639" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>You can see I&#8217;ve filled in the <em>description</em> and <em>command</em> for <em>User Job #1</em>. The command uses parameter variables which are filled in by MythTV (a list of the variables is on the <a href="http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/User_Jobs" target="_blank">User Jobs</a> MythTV wiki page). Here&#8217;s the command in full, as it&#8217;s not visible in this screenshot:</p>
<pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">
/usr/local/bin/h264xcode %CHANID% %STARTTIME%
</pre>
<p>Alternatively, configure these settings in the MythWeb interface. Click on the big spanner (for Settings) and choose <em>MythTV</em> from the list of buttons on the left. Scroll down and you&#8217;ll find a field called <em>UserJob1</em> and another called <em> UserJobDesc1 </em> just a little below. These take the same values as in the <code>mythtv-setup</code> interface:</p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-582" href="http://blog.gorwits.me.uk/2011/09/04/mythtv-transcoding-3-transcoding-for-ipad-playback/screen-shot-2011-09-04-at-12-32-33/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-582" title="MythWeb Settings - MythTV" src="http://blog.gorwits.me.uk/wp-content/blog.gorwits.me.uk/2011/09/Screen-shot-2011-09-04-at-12.32.33.png" alt="" width="655" height="306" /></a></p>
<p>Don&#8217;t worry about the dummy values in other User Job description fields &#8211; unless the Job has a command set, it&#8217;s ignored. If you did use MythWeb, you <span style="text-decoration: underline;">must</span> now restart your MythTV Backend process to get these updated settings.</p>
<p>Hop over to MythWeb, and you should now see a new &#8220;H.264 Encode&#8221; button for each recording, which fires off a transcode Job that&#8217;s also visible in the MythWeb Job Queue:</p>

<p>If you have the disk space, and want this to happen for all recordings automatically, check out the instructions from <a href="http://blog.gorwits.me.uk/2011/02/13/mythtv-transcoding-2-in-place-auto-transcoding/" target="_blank">part 2</a> of this series. You should tick the <em>Run user job</em> box in MythFrontend settings, and also note that this only takes effect for new Recording Schedules, although I explain a fix for existing schedules at the end of the article. Don&#8217;t forget to clean up old transcode files after a while!</p>
<p>The final step on my road to iPad streaming is to embed this video into MythWeb, which I&#8217;ll cover in the next article.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iâ€™m doing a series of posts here on automated transcoding of recordings in MythTV. The idea is to explain the basics, then evolve the design to end up with recordings suitable for playback on the iPad, which is a little more advanced.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>The complete series of articles is available atÂ <a href="http://blog.gorwits.me.uk/category/transcoding/" target="_self">this page</a></em></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://blog.gorwits.me.uk/2011/02/13/mythtv-transcoding-2-in-place-auto-transcoding/" target="_blank">Last time</a> I showed where you go in MythTV to edit the default job settings, and what happens when you hit the Transcode button in MythWeb or let MythTV transcode automatically after recording.</p>
<p>Today I&#8217;m going to continue the series by leaving MythTV to one side, and showing how to create a transcoded recording suitable for playback on an iPad (or other Apple device &#8211; iPod, iPhone, Mac OS X, etc). Next time we&#8217;ll incorporate this into MythWeb for the final result.</p>
<p>Before that, let&#8217;s look at the different ways that playback on Apple platforms might be achieved (more suggestions are welcome, in the comments):</p>
<ul>
<li>Install the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mythtvformacosx/files/" target="_blank">MythFrontend</a> application natively onto an OS X device.</li>
<li>Install the <a href="http://www.vlcmediaplayer.org/" target="_blank">VLC Media Player</a> onto an OS X device (as it can handle the <em>ASX Stream</em> link in MythWeb) &#8211; in fact this is what I do on my own desktop Mac.</li>
<li>Install <a href="http://code.google.com/p/mythpodcaster/" target="_blank">MythPodcaster</a>, a Transcoder and RSS publisher, and subscribe to transcoded recordings in iTunes (leads to syncing them to the iPad).</li>
<li>Create a MythTV Job to transcode into <a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/what-is/" target="_blank">H.264</a> format (compatible with all Apple platforms), and add links to the generated files in MythWeb.</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#8217;s the last of these which I&#8217;m going to cover in this article. However an honourable mention must be made of MythPodcaster. First, most of the work here is taken from looking at what that excellent tool does. Second, if you don&#8217;t want to mess about editing MythWeb, then MythPodcaster has its own web interface for not only managing transcode schedules and profiles, but also browsing and playback. It really is an excellent tool I recommend you check out.</p>
<p>Each MythTV user job is configured as a command which can be executed at the shell command-line. That means the first thing to do is get transcoding working at the command-line for ourselves. The tool for this is <code>ffmpeg</code>, but we must compile a special version which can output H.264. The following instructions are for an Ubuntu system and based on the MythPodcaster <a href="http://code.google.com/p/mythpodcaster/wiki/InstallationOnMythBuntu" target="_blank">InstallationOnMythBuntu</a> page.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to build a custom version of <code>ffmeg</code>, separate to that installed with my Ubuntu system. The instructions below aren&#8217;t intended to be the cleanest solution, but get the job done.</p>
<pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">
sudo apt-get install build-essential git-core yasm checkinstall zlib1g-dev pkg-config
</pre>
<p>And we&#8217;ll do this work as the <code>mythtv</code> user in a new directory:</p>
<pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">
sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/lib/ffmpeg-264
sudo chown mythtv:mythtv /usr/local/lib/ffmpeg-264
sudo su - mythtv
cd /usr/local/lib/ffmpeg-264
</pre>
<p>Build the faac library:</p>
<pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">
cd /usr/local/lib/ffmpeg-264
wget http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/faac/faac-src/faac-1.28/faac-1.28.tar.gz
tar -zxvf faac-1.28.tar.gz
cd faac-1.28
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/lib/ffmpeg-264 --enable-static --disable-shared
# some kind of gcc-compatibility bug which needs fixing
sed -i -e &quot;s|^char \*strcasestr.*|//&#92;&#48;|&quot; common/mp4v2/mpeg4ip.h
make &amp;&amp; make install
</pre>
<p>Build the x264 library:</p>
<pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">
cd /usr/local/lib/ffmpeg-264
git clone git://git.videolan.org/x264.git
cd x264
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/lib/ffmpeg-264 --enable-static --disable-shared
make &amp;&amp; make install
</pre>
<p>Build the libmp3lame library:</p>
<pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">
cd /usr/local/lib/ffmpeg-264
wget http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/lame/lame/3.98.4/lame-3.98.4.tar.gz
tar -zxvf lame-3.98.4.tar.gz
cd lame-3.98.4
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/lib/ffmpeg-264 --enable-static --disable-shared
make &amp;&amp; make install
</pre>
<p>Build ffmpeg:</p>
<pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">
cd /usr/local/lib/ffmpeg-264
wget http://www.ffmpeg.org/releases/ffmpeg-0.8.3.tar.gz
tar -zxvf ffmpeg-0.8.3.tar.gz
cd ffmpeg-0.8.3
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/lib/ffmpeg-264 --extra-version=static --disable-debug --enable-static --extra-cflags=--static --disable-ffplay --disable-ffserver --disable-doc --enable-gpl --enable-pthreads --enable-postproc --enable-gray --enable-runtime-cpudetect --enable-libfaac --enable-libmp3lame --enable-libx264 --enable-nonfree --enable-version3 --disable-devices --extra-ldflags=-L/usr/local/lib/ffmpeg-264/lib --extra-cflags=-I/usr/local/lib/ffmpeg-264/include
make &amp;&amp; make install
</pre>
<p>To make life a little easier, I link to this new binary from a more memorable location:</p>
<pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">
exit # if you are still the &quot;mythtv&quot; user
sudo ln -s /usr/local/lib/ffmpeg-264/bin/ffmpeg /usr/local/bin/ffmpeg-264
</pre>
<p>Now we need a magic incantation for ffmpeg-264 which will result in an H.264 file suitable for iPad playback. A good source of possible command line options is the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/mythpodcaster/source/browse/trunk/src/main/conf/transcoding_profiles.xml" target="_blank">MythPodcaster trancoding profiles</a> XML file. In this file, the various iPad profiles, as their names suggest, will ask for various formats and qualities of output (see each <code>encoderArguments</code> key).</p>
<p>These command line options in turn refer to ffmpeg <em>presets</em> (via <code>-vpre</code>) which should be shipped with ffmpeg in the <em>ffpresets</em> directory. Some of these might work, but I&#8217;m pretty happy with two presets from an older version of ffmpeg:</p>
<pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">
mkdir ~mythtv/.ffmpeg
cd ~mythtv/.ffmpeg
wget https://raw.github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/release/0.6/ffpresets/libx264-main.ffpreset
wget https://raw.github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/release/0.6/ffpresets/libx264-medium.ffpreset
</pre>
<p>One problem you might have with ffmpeg options is selection of an audio track in recordings with multiple soundtracks (for example normal, and <a href="http://www.tvhelp.org.uk/audes/whatis.html" target="_blank">audio-descriptive</a>). There&#8217;s no easy way to know which you want (and in my settings I force the choice). Here&#8217;s what I settled on, which seems to work OK for SD content, and if you have others please add a comment, below:</p>
<pre class="brush: plain; title: ; notranslate">
-i &lt;infile&gt; -y -map 0:0 -map 0:1 -er 4 -f ipod -acodec libfaac -ac 2 -ab 128k \
    -ar 44100 -deinterlace -vcodec libx264 -vpre medium -vpre main -b 1200k \
    -bt 1200k -maxrate 1200k -bufsize 1200k -level 30 -r 30 -g 90 -async 2 \
    -threads 0 -v 0 &lt;outfile&gt;
</pre>
<p>These parameters are wrapped up in a script, making things easier for MythTV configuration. This file, called <code>h264xcode</code> is also placed in <code>/usr/local/bin</code> (and obviously, season this to taste, for your system&#8217;s recording directories):</p>
<pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">
#!/bin/bash

CHANID=$1
STARTTIME=$2

INDIR=&quot;/mnt/mythtv-video/Videos/MythTV&quot;
OUTDIR=&quot;/mnt/mythtv-video/Videos/iPad&quot;

PROG=&quot;time nice -n 19 /usr/local/bin/ffmpeg-264&quot;
PARAMS=&quot;-y -map 0:0 -map 0:1 -er 4 -f ipod -acodec libfaac -ac 2 -ab 128k -ar 44100 -deinterlace -vcodec libx264 -vpre medium -vpre main -b 1200k -bt 1200k -maxrate 1200k -bufsize 1200k -level 30 -r 30 -g 90 -async 2 -threads 0 -v 0&quot;

LOG=&quot;/var/log/mythtv/h264xcode.log&quot;
OUTFILE=&quot;${OUTDIR}/${CHANID}_${STARTTIME}&quot;

COMMAND=&quot;${PROG} -i ${INDIR}/${CHANID}_${STARTTIME}.mpg ${PARAMS} ${OUTFILE}.m4v.tmp&quot;

echo &quot;h264xcode: ${COMMAND}&quot; &gt;&gt; $LOG
$COMMAND &gt;&gt; $LOG 2&gt;&amp;1
mv -f ${OUTFILE}.m4v.tmp ${OUTFILE}.m4v &gt;&gt; $LOG 2&gt;&amp;1
rm -f ${OUTFILE}.m4v.tmp &gt;&gt; $LOG 2&gt;&amp;1
</pre>
<p>Let&#8217;s work through what&#8217;s going on, here. The script takes two arguments &#8211; the channel ID and the start time of the recording (we&#8217;ll see how MythTV passes these, later). From them it&#8217;s possible to locate the original recording file on disk, using the <code>$INDIR</code> variable.</p>
<p>Next a simple log is set up, and the proposed ffmpeg-264 command echoed to that file. Finally the command itself is run, with a low system priority (<code>nice -n 19</code>), and the output directed to the log file. The H.264 file is saved in <code>$OUTDIR</code>.</p>
<p>So far so good. All that remains is to let MythTV know about this new user job command, which we&#8217;ll cover in the next article in this series.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iâ€™m doing a series of posts here on automated transcoding of recordings in MythTV. The idea is to explain the basics, then evolve the design to end up with recordings suitable for playback on the iPad, which is a little more advanced.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>The complete series of articles is available atÂ <a href="http://blog.gorwits.me.uk/category/transcoding/" target="_self">this page</a></em></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://blog.gorwits.me.uk/2011/02/10/mythtv-transcoding-1-the-beginning/" target="_blank">Last time</a> I enabled transcoding on the back-end server, and showed that hitting the <em>Transcode</em> button in MythWeb fired off a job. Today I&#8217;m going to show what that job is doing.</p>
<p>If you have the MythTV Frontend running then you&#8217;re all set to begin. Otherwise, log into your MythTV box and start the Frontend application (these are instructions for 0.24):</p>
<pre class="brush: plain; title: ; notranslate">
workstation:~$ ssh -Y mythtv.example.com
mythtv:~$ mythfrontend --windowed --geometry 640x480
</pre>
<p>Navigate to <em>Utilities/Setup</em>, <em>Setup</em>, <em>TV Settings</em>, <em>General</em>, and hit <em>Next</em> until you end up on the <em>General (Jobs)</em> screen:</p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-392" href="http://blog.gorwits.me.uk/2011/02/13/mythtv-transcoding-2-in-place-auto-transcoding/screen-shot-2011-02-13-at-16-53-15/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-392" title="General Settings (Jobs)" src="http://blog.gorwits.me.uk/wp-content/blog.gorwits.me.uk/2011/02/Screen-shot-2011-02-13-at-16.53.15.png" alt="" width="639" height="479" /></a>First settle your eye on the <em>Default transcoder</em> option in the centre of the screen. There are a number of predefined Transcoders (which we&#8217;ll come to shortly), and this is where you choose the one to be run when the <em>Transcode</em> button is pushed in MythWeb.</p>
<p>Below this option are tick boxes for each kind of Job that we saw in my last blog post. Whereas before we simply permitted them to be run <span style="text-decoration: underline;">manually</span>, or not, these options control whether this is done <span style="text-decoration: underline;">automatically</span>. However this applies to newly created Recording Schedules only. For example if you already have a Schedule for a TV series, new episodes won&#8217;t be auto-transcoded, we need to fix each existing Schedule, and I&#8217;ll show how to do that below.</p>
<p>Now we know where to choose the default Transcode profile and enable automatic transcoding for new recordings, let&#8217;s look at these mysterious profiles. Navigate toÂ <em>Utilities/Setup</em>,Â <em>Setup</em>,Â <em>TV Settings</em>,Â <em>Recording Profiles</em>, <em>Transcoders</em> to end up on this screen:</p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-393" href="http://blog.gorwits.me.uk/2011/02/13/mythtv-transcoding-2-in-place-auto-transcoding/screen-shot-2011-02-13-at-16-59-05/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-393" title="Transcoding Profiles" src="http://blog.gorwits.me.uk/wp-content/blog.gorwits.me.uk/2011/02/Screen-shot-2011-02-13-at-16.59.05.png" alt="" width="638" height="154" /></a>You might have spotted that two profiles are called <em>Autodetect from&#8230;</em>, and indeed these are used when the <em>Default transcoder</em> we saw above is set to <em>Autodetect</em>. Selecting the <em>Autodetect from MPEG2</em> profile shows it&#8217;s quite simple:</p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-394" href="http://blog.gorwits.me.uk/2011/02/13/mythtv-transcoding-2-in-place-auto-transcoding/screen-shot-2011-02-13-at-17-01-39/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-394" title="Autodetect from MPEG2" src="http://blog.gorwits.me.uk/wp-content/blog.gorwits.me.uk/2011/02/Screen-shot-2011-02-13-at-17.01.39.png" alt="" width="639" height="478" /></a>So why have a profile which seems to do nothing? Two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you have previously run a <em>Commercial-detection</em> Job, the cutpoints for ad breaks will be stored, and the in-place transcode is an opportunity to remove those sections of the video.</li>
<li>Sometimes MPEG recordings can contain &#8220;glitches&#8221; or MythTV has trouble seeking within the video; an in-place transcode is an opportunity to rebuild all the metadata, which helps resolve problems.</li>
</ol>
<p>It&#8217;s for the second reason that I have automatic in-place transcoding enabled even though I don&#8217;t use commercial detection.Â If you want to transcode to save disk space, take a look at the other <em>Transcoders</em> available, and consider either setting one to be the <em>Default transcoder</em> or creating your own.</p>
<p>All that remains is for me to fix the automatic transcode setting for my existing recordings, to be in line with new recordings. The only way I know is by editing the backend database directly, but this is strongly discouraged by the MythTV developers. Anyway, at the <code>mysql</code> prompt (get the password from <code>/etc/mythtv/mysql.txt</code>):</p>
<pre class="brush: plain; title: ; notranslate">
mythtv:~$ mysql -u mythtv -p mythconverg
Enter password:

mysql&gt; update record set autotranscode = 1;
Query OK, 72 rows affected (0.11 sec)
Rows matched: 72  Changed: 72  Warnings: 0
</pre>
<p>If you want to do the same for <em>Commerical-detection</em>, set the <code>autocommflag</code> field.</p>
<p>Next time I&#8217;ll take a break from MythTV and look at how to transcode an MPEG2 file for the iPad using command line tools.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m going to do a series of posts here on automated transcoding of recordings in MythTV. The idea is to explain the basics, then evolve the design to end up with recordings suitable for playback on the iPad, which is a little more advanced.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>The complete series of articles is available at <a href="http://blog.gorwits.me.uk/category/transcoding/" target="_self">this page</a></em></li>
</ul>
<p>What is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcoding" target="_blank">transcoding</a>? The data saved to disk by MythTV from your TV tuner cards has both a format, and a bit-rate. These are usually particular to how the TV station is broadcast and/or how your tuner hardware works. The idea of transcoding is to change either or both properties, perhaps to enable playback on another device, or to save on disk space used.</p>
<p>MythTV includes a transcoding system and support for some data formats and bit-rates (but not all). In this first session I&#8217;ll enable really basic, manual transcoding.</p>
<p>What catches people out is that just hitting the <em>Transcode</em> button in MythWeb will not work unless the backend is allowed to transcode. That&#8217;s done in <code>mythtv-setup</code>, the program you probably ran years ago and forgot all about (or never ran).</p>
<p>Log into your MythTV box (these are instructions for 0.24):</p>
<pre class="brush: plain; title: ; notranslate">
workstation:~$ ssh -Y mythtv.example.com
mythtv:~$ mythtv-setup --geometry 640x480
</pre>
<p>Select <em>General</em> and then hit <em>Next</em> until you reach the <em>Job Queue (backend specific)</em> page:</p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-353" href="http://blog.gorwits.me.uk/2011/02/10/mythtv-transcoding-1-the-beginning/screen-shot-2011-02-09-at-21-36-43/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-353" title="Job Queue (backend specific)" src="http://blog.gorwits.me.uk/wp-content/blog.gorwits.me.uk/2011/02/Screen-shot-2011-02-09-at-21.36.43.png" alt="" width="640" height="481" /></a></p>
<p>The notable settings are the six <em>Allow &#8230; Jobs</em> tick-boxes. As you can see I have commercial-detection disabled, and the effect is that even if I hit the <em>Flag Commercials</em> button in MythWeb the job will never start (it will just sit in the job queue).Â There are three types of job:</p>
<h6><em>Edit: updated descriptions due to feedback from a friend &#8211; thanks, Colin!</em></h6>
<ul>
<li><strong>Commercial-detection</strong>: this will attempt to detect and store the commercial break points in TV shows (not a transcode, but may be used by one)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Transcoding</strong>: what you set to happen when you hit <em>Transcode</em> in MythWeb, which (usually)Â <span style="text-decoration: underline;">replaces the original recording file<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Four User Jobs</strong>: scripts you create that transcode (or anything else), which we&#8217;ll come to later, and typically don&#8217;t replace the original recording file</li>
</ul>
<p>Hitting <em>Next</em> takes you to the <em>Job Queue (Global)</em> transcode settings page:</p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-345" href="http://blog.gorwits.me.uk/2011/02/10/mythtv-transcoding-1-the-beginning/screen-shot-2011-02-09-at-18-59-07/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-345" title="Job Queue (Global)" src="http://blog.gorwits.me.uk/wp-content/blog.gorwits.me.uk/2011/02/Screen-shot-2011-02-09-at-18.59.07.png" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a>An interesting option is <em>Save original files after transcoding (globally)</em>. If you transcode and intend to replace the original recording file (as in bullet two, above), this is a way to preserve a backup should things go wrong. If you do, just make sure there&#8217;s a <code>cron</code> job or similar to delete these old files as otherwise your disk will fill up.</p>
<p>Finally, hitting <em>Next</em> will show the third transcode-related page where you can configure the <em>User Jobs</em> I mentioned in bullet three, above. I&#8217;ll save these for another blog post to come.</p>
<p>So far I&#8217;ve allowed transcode jobs but not actually asked MythTV to to run any. Bringing up the MythWeb page for a recorded show (click the thumbnail from <em>Recorded Programs</em>) presents a <em>Transcode</em> button which now works:</p>
