On --- we will undertake the final phase of upgrading the site infrastructure to support the new Cray supercomputer. This work will entail turning off the mains electricity supply to the site for 10 hours to install two new 11,000 Volt circuit breakers.
</p><p>
In preparation for this work, we first need to shut down C2B (one of the IBM supercomputers), reducing the total site load by 1.2 Mega Watts. We can then transfer the portion of the site that runs on the mains supply on to the critical supply that is protected by our UPS. After that, the external supply to the site will be disconnected and the UPSs will generate the load we still need. If all goes to plan, all you will notice will be the exhaust fumes coming out of the UPS buildings. When this work is complete, the circuit breakers will be connected to the two new transformers that have been installed at the rear of the computer hall extension, which will then power up the second Cray cluster.

Facts:
<ul>
<li>The Centre has four 1.4MW DRUPS (Diesel Rotary Uninterruptable Power Supplies) machines with a combined power output of 5.6MW.
<li>During the shutdown, each machine will use 500 litres of diesel per hour.
<li>We hold 50,000 litres of fuel on site.
</ul>
