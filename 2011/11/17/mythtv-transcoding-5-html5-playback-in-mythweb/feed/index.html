		<description><![CDATA[Hey, thanks for your write ups, they helped me get what I needed to get done.

since mine is on a mac, I used handbrake cli, however I Didn&#039;t like the generic name that I was using during my post job transcoding and while looking through the code, I was just going to say that, this code seems to be a little better


  &lt;source
    src=&quot;/h264xcode/filename ?&gt;&quot;&gt;
  Your browser does not support the video tag.


because it works off of the filename, instead of creating the filename by aggregating the properties.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Bill,

My intention was to replace the flowplayer with the HTML5 player, but I must confess only to testing it on Mac/Chrome and I believe various elements on the page are conditional on the browser platform.

You can of course insert the HTML5 video tag anywhere convenient on any page in MythWeb, so long as its file link is correct.

regards,
oliver.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi,
Thanks for this. Was easy to follow along.
Can&#039;t seem to get the html5 player to work in the last step though.
Question: 
What version Mythtv and Mythweb were you working with?
Seems like in the latest Mythweb retrieved from git, the code
in modules/tv/tmpl/default/detail.php may be a little different? 
At least the copy I have here, there is no line 791.
Am able to find the two lines comprising the Direct Download hyperlink
(I think) but when I replace them with the 5 lines of php code it doesn&#039;t seem to work.
I&#039;m guessing the expected behaviour would be both a flash flowplayer window, and the html5 based player window? Or am I misinterpreting what your trying to accomplish?]]></description>
